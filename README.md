# Tetris 

## Used C#, the Unity engine and video game software design patterns.

## In my implementation, I chose to try to follow the specifications of [Tetris Guideline](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline).

## The implemented features are:

- Main Menu
- Instructions
- Rotate piece
- Hold
- Piece preview
- Playfield (10 x 20)
- Piece colors
- Random Generator
- Ghost piece
- Levels
- Music
- Game over (Top out)
- Score (with saving highscore)
